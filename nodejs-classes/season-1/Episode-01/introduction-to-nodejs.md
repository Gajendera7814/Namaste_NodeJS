# Introduction to Node.js

## What is Node.js

**Node.js** is an **open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment** that allows developers to execute JavaScript code **outside the web browser**.

It is built on the **Google Chrome V8 engine** and is mainly used for building **fast, scalable, and data-intensive server-side applications**.

---

# JavaScript Runtime Environment

A **runtime environment** is the environment where a program executes.

JavaScript usually runs in **web browsers** like:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Edge

But **Node.js allows JavaScript to run outside the browser**, such as on a **server or local machine**.

---

# V8 Engine

The **V8 Engine** is a JavaScript engine developed by Google.

It:

* Compiles JavaScript into **machine code**
* Executes the code very **fast**
* Uses **Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation**

Node.js uses the **Chrome V8 Engine** to run JavaScript.

---

# Open Source

**Open source** means the **source code is publicly available**.

Developers can:

* View the source code
* Modify it
* Contribute to the project

---

# Cross Platform

Cross-platform means Node.js applications can run on multiple operating systems without major changes.

Supported platforms:

* Windows
* macOS
* Linux

---

# Why Node.js is Used

Node.js is used to build:

* Web servers
* APIs
* Real-time applications
* Streaming apps
* Chat applications

Examples:

* Netflix
* PayPal
* Uber
* Trello

# Built-in Modules (APIs)

Node.js provides **built-in modules** that help developers perform common tasks.

Examples:

| Module | Use                    |
| ------ | ---------------------- |
| fs     | File system operations |
| http   | Create web servers     |
| path   | Work with file paths   |
| os     | System information     |
| events | Event handling         |

Example:

```js
const fs = require('fs');

fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
 console.log(data);
});
```

# Node.js is Not a Programming Language

Node.js is **not a programming language**.

It is a **runtime environment** that allows JavaScript to run **outside the browser**.
